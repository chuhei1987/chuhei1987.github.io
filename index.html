There are some links have been preparing, as It is said, not fully trusting one point so have to fine alternative ways. I end up with IPFS.

It is tricky to set that right as things are messier than I thought even I am familiar with *nix. 

There is a IPFS cid for accessing what I have found , QmQwj6LKmLkACXTpA1iwirZEMKrFuEA66fkiW6PiuVFPm4 . You may need using ipfs desktop to access that due to the total size (300GB+ when you download all!).

You may visit this via ipfs.chuhei.net/ipfs/QmQwj6LKmLkACXTpA1iwirZEMKrFuEA66fkiW6PiuVFPm4 , I allow this gateway for you reading the menu only , discouragement of download these from gateway. I have set rules to enforce that, you like some? Then at least using ipfs desktop to get them.

How to be sure?
1. Each being on IPFS are scanned with SHA2-256 at least, some of them may involve different hashing method, of course, stronger. 

2. Some material contains official infomation, Have to find way to copy these as well. Technically speaking, you either wget , FTP or CURL -RJO for the mtime, may F12 from browser shall do? Perhaps yes, It is believed that move is bad. Even mtime is known not fully reliable, I still ask both, mtime and checksum (SHA256, SM3, Whirlpool, SHA512, SHA3-512, SHA3-256) just for saving my days.

How to help me?
1. You may consider to pin some of material you obtained via ipfs desktop, keep beaming just like using bittorrent. 
2. You may tip me via ko-fi . 
3. You may tip me via Bitcoin , The address is 3DbuhZWjrcdLnakmxBoyKAwfgN73orZL3G , which is as same as you see at https://neocities.org/site/chuhei
